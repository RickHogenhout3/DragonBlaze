        <p> I am DragonBlaze! a.k.a Andrew!</p> 
        <p>I'm a YouTuber/Twitch streamer who likes to have fun and entertain people! </p>
<p>Used to be all about Inazuma Eleven on YT and now I'm playing basically whatever. Usually something on the Nintendo Switch.</p> 
<p>Hope you guys will enjoy this page, it is pretty much going to be about.. well.. me!</p> 
<p>Going to make it more personal to have my subs know who I am and stuff and hopefully it will be a fun time!</p> 
<p>I will try and update this page as much as I can!</p>
<p>If there ever is a idea of a certain page you would like to see on my Website, just say it.</p>
<p>This is a page for myself, but also like I said for my subscribers, so if there ever would be a thing that you would like to know, just say so and I'll think about it if I will add it to the website! :] </p>
<p>Hopefully you guys will all enjoy and the way of talking to me if there ever would be a moment when you want to advice me something on the page can be done through Discord!</p>
