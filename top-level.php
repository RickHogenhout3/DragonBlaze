        <h1>Welcome to Top Level</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Top Level is a company that helps young people through gaming. Gaming is used as a tool to organize activities and offer services to support young people who have goals in life.</p>
            <p>Tournaments, coaching, and workshops are the services currently offered. More services will be available in the future!</p>
            <p>At Top Level, the focus is on how you can be best supported and how you can lead a fun life!</p>
            <p>If you have a passion for gaming or just want to expand your network, then Top Level is the place for you! Will I see you soon?</p>

            <p>As a graduated Social Cultural Worker, I have worked as a youth worker in Almere and Amsterdam.</p>
            <p>I have also volunteered for over 3 years and ran a gaming activity in Almere where I bring lonely young people together through gaming. I also have more than 3 years of experience within youth groups such as youth councils, where I have held roles such as core member, vice-chairman, chairman, and coach.</p>
            <p>One of the topics I focus a lot on is self-confidence. I do this through conversations and setting goals related to this. For this, I have also followed a program where I learned how to coach and will receive a certificate for it.</p>
            <p>Helping people in a fun way is my goal. Through gaming, you can learn various skills and gain experiences that can boost your self-confidence both in and out of the game.</p>
            <p>Not only will you get much better at the game you are playing, but you'll also learn much more about yourself, and the process of getting better at the game becomes a lot more fun!</p>
            <p>The knowledge you can gain about how you play the game, but also about who you are as a person playing it, is, in my opinion, priceless! I hope to help many of you in whatever way I can...</p>
            <p>"so you can get to The Top Level"</p>
